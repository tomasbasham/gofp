# gofp

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Go module. A short
introduction of this module could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer:

- [Go](https://golang.org/): any one of the **three latest major**
  [releases](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html)

## Installation

With [Go module](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules) support (Go 1.11+), simply add the
following import

```go
import "github.com/tomasbasham/gofp"
```

to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]` will automatically fetch the
necessary dependencies.

Otherwise, to install the `gofp` module, run the following command:
